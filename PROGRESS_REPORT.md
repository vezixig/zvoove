- **Stories Delivered:** 5/5 (100% completion rate)
- **On-Time Delivery:** 4/6 phases delivered on or under time
- **Risk Mitigation:** No critical delays encountered

### Technical Achievements

- ✅ Custom scoring algorithm implementation
- ✅ Responsive mobile-first design
- ✅ Real-time search and filtering
- ✅ Data visualization with Chart.js
- ✅ Complete Docker containerization
- ✅ Signal-based state management
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Quality Metrics

- **API Integration:** GitHub REST API successfully integrated with rate limiting considerations
- **Caching Strategy:** 6-hour in-memory caching implemented
- **UI/UX:** Mobile-responsive design with loading states and error handling
- **Code Quality:** SOLID principles and clean code practices followed

## Notable Challenges & Solutions

### 1. GitHub API Rate Limiting

- **Challenge:** GitHub API has 60 requests/hour limit for unauthenticated requests
- **Solution:** Implemented 6-hour caching strategy and limited to first 1000 repositories

### 2. Custom Scoring Algorithm

- **Challenge:** Balancing multiple factors (stars, forks, issues, activity) into meaningful score
- **Solution:** Logarithmic scaling with weighted factors for balanced representation

### 3. Real-time Filtering

- **Challenge:** Ensuring performant search across repository data
- **Solution:** Client-side filtering with debouncing and signal-based state management

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

- Missing comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e)
- Limited code documentation
- Mixed styling approaches (classes and inline styles)
- No user authentication for increased API limits

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Testing Strategy:** Implement comprehensive test suite using Jasmine and Playwright
2. **Architecture Enhancement:** Migrate to clean architecture with mediator pattern
3. **Performance Optimization:** Implement Redis caching for production scalability
4. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Establish automated testing and deployment processes
5. **Monitoring:** Add application logging and performance monitoring
